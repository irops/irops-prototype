# Here's a list of the commands which need to be run to delete the Stable MultiEnvironment (us-west-2 / Oregon)
# - It's very likely some of these will fail due to manual changes, requiring
#   this script to be run until a failure, stopped with manual steps to clear
#   out what's blocking the deletion, then a restart, until done.
